  "head1": "What is Python?",
  "text1": "Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.\nIt is used for:\n\n web development (server side),\n software development,\n mathematics,\n system scripting.",
  "head2": "What can Python do?",
  "text2": "Python can be used on a server to create web applications.\nPython can be used alongside software to create workflows.\nPython can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\nPython can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\nPython can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.",
  "head3": "Why Python?",
  "text3": "Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\nPython has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\nPython has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\nPython runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\nPython can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.",
  "head4": "Good to know",
  "text4": "The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.\nIn this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.",
  "head5": "Python Syntax compared to other programming languages",
  "text5": "Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\nPython uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\nPython relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.",
